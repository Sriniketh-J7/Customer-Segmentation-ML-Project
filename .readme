# 🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project performs **Customer Segmentation** using **K-Means Clustering** and provides visual analysis through an interactive **Streamlit Dashboard**.  
Users can upload a dataset, select features, analyze clusters, and export a **PDF report** of the results.

## 📌 Features

| Feature | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **CSV Upload** | Upload your customer dataset in `.csv` format |
| **Feature Selection** | Choose the features used to form clusters |
| **Standard Scaling** | The data is normalized before clustering |
| **Elbow Method** | Helps determine the optimal number of clusters |
| **K-Means Clustering** | Creates customer groups based on similarity |
| **Cluster Visualization** | Plot clusters and centroids on a scatter plot |
| **Cluster Summary** | View per-cluster average feature values |
| **PDF Export** | Download a professional segmentation report |

## 📂 Project Setup

### 1️⃣ Install Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
2️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
bash
Copy code
streamlit run customer_segmentation.py
📁 Dataset Format
Your dataset should be a CSV file containing numeric customer attributes such as:

CustomerID	Age	Annual Income (k$)	Spending Score (1-100)
001	19	15	39
002	21	15	81

You may select any 2+ numeric columns during runtime.

🎯 How It Works
Upload dataset

Select the features (e.g., Income & Spending Score)

View Elbow Curve → choose best number of clusters K

Visualize the cluster scatter plot with centroids

Analyze cluster summary table

Export PDF Report (optional)

📄 Sample Output (Cluster Plot)
yaml
Copy code
Cluster 1: Low income, low spending
Cluster 2: High income, high spending
Cluster 3: High income, low spending
Cluster 4: Low income, high spending
Each group helps businesses target different customer types effectively.

📤 PDF Report Example
The exported report includes:

Cluster count

Average feature values for every cluster

Organized summary for understanding customer behavior
